CiviCRM-CiviAuthenticate
========================

Authentication plugin for Joomla which allows us to restrict frontend login access based on whether the user is a member in good standing and various other criteria.

In addition to creating membership-status-based access criteria, the user can configure the plugin to assign a Joomla Access Level based on the membership status or type, allow login using username (standard) or email address (alternate), and control where the user is redirected based on various status combinations.
